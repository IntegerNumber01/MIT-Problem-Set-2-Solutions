# Show that it is possible to buy exactly 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55 McNuggets, by finding
# solutions to the Diophantine equation. You can solve this in your head, using paper and pencil,
# or writing a program. However you chose to solve this problem, list the combinations of 6, 9
# and 20 packs of McNuggets you need to buy in order to get each of the exact amounts.
# Given that it is possible to buy sets of 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 or 55 McNuggets by combinations of 6,
# 9 and 20 packs, show that it is possible to buy 56, 57,â€¦, 65 McNuggets. In other words, show
# how, given solutions for 50-55, one can derive solutions for 56-65.
