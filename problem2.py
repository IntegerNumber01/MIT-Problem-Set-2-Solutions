# Theorem: If it is possible to buy x, x+1,..., x+5 sets of McNuggets, for some x, then it is
# possible to buy any number of McNuggets >= x, given that McNuggets come in 6, 9 and 20
# packs.

# Explain, in English, why this theorem is true

# 50 + 2 = 52
# 50 + 3 = 53
# 50 + 4 = 54
# 50 + 5 = 55
# 50 + 6 = 56
# 50 + 7 = 50 + 1 + 6
